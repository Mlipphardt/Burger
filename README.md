Burgertime is an app to simulate the experience of creating a unique grilled creation and subsequently eating it.

Upon visiting the webpage, users are presented with a list of every burger created. When first created, a burger will appear in the list on the left-hand side accompanied by a button labeled "devour."

If pressed, the "devour" button will move its associated burger to the right-hand side in the "devoured" column.

The follow technologies were used in the creation this app:

- Node.js, in conjuction with module express.js, was used to code the server.

- MySQL was used to store and update information.
- Bootstrap was used both for general CSS as well as its modal popup plugin.
- JQuery was used for sending requests to the Burgertime API.
